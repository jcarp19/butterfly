      <h2>This is my story and I'm sticking to it!</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever sat in a bar with a friend or loved one discussing
        business ideas and what you'd name this new enndevour? I have, and,
        well, that's exactly what happed here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been developing web sites for years. Not just as my profession, but
        also for freind's business ventures, and as my hobby. So, sitting in a
        bar one night with my wife other, we got to talking... what if. By the
        end of the night I had bought a domain and started filling out business
        paperwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, here I am with the result of that festive and whacky
        conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's it all mean, well, it's deep... as deep as a few adult beverages
        will help you go.
      </p>
      <p>What do we do and how will it work?</p>
